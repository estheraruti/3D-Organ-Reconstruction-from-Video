This is a project I did, reconstructing a 3D model of a heart from a series of 2D images. From image preprocessing, feature detection and extracting, feature matching, calculating the fundamental and essential matrix, triangulation, depth and disparity maps, dense reconstruction, and finally point cloud generation, and rendering.
